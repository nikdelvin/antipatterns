## About This Project

This documentation accompanies the "Worst Backend Ever" educational project - a codebase intentionally designed to demonstrate every antipattern imaginable.

Each section includes:
- **Real code examples** from the project
- **Explanation** of why it's problematic
- **The right way** to implement the same functionality
- **Detection tips** for code reviews

:::caution[Warning]
The accompanying codebase contains intentional security vulnerabilities and bad practices. Never deploy it or use its patterns in production code.
