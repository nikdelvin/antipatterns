## Structure of Each Antipattern

Every antipattern in this guide follows a consistent structure:

### 1. Overview
A brief explanation of what the antipattern is and why it's problematic.

### 2. Real Code Example
Actual code from the "Worst Backend Ever" project demonstrating the antipattern in action.

```javascript title="src/bad-example.js"
// This is how NOT to do it
```

### 3. Why It's Bad
Detailed explanation of the problems this pattern causes:
- Performance issues
- Maintainability nightmares
- Security vulnerabilities
- Testing difficulties

### 4. The Right Way
Correct implementation of the same functionality:

```javascript title="src/good-example.js"
// This is the proper way
```

### 5. Detection Tips
How to spot this antipattern in code reviews and what tools can help.

## Color Coding

Throughout this guide, we use color coding to distinguish between good and bad practices:

<div class="wrong-way">
This is an example of bad code that should be avoided.
</div>

<div class="right-way">
This is an example of good code that you should follow.
</div>
