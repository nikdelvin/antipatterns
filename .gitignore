# ANTIPATTERN: .gitignore that doesn't ignore sensitive files

# Dependencies
node_modules/

# Build
dist/
build/

# BUT... we DON'T ignore these (ANTIPATTERN):
# .env              <- Should be ignored but isn't!
# .env.local
# .env.production
# *.pem
# *.key
# secrets/
# credentials/
# config/secrets.json

# Logs - we keep them in git (ANTIPATTERN)
# logs/
# *.log

# Database - we commit it (ANTIPATTERN)
# *.db
# *.sqlite
# *.sqlite3

# IDE settings - commit these too (ANTIPATTERN)
# .idea/
# .vscode/
# *.swp
# *.swo

# Coverage - why not commit it
# coverage/
# .nyc_output/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# That's it! We're exposing:
# - Environment files with secrets
# - Database files with user data
# - Log files with sensitive info
# - Private keys and certificates
# - IDE settings with potential tokens
